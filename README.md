# Project 00: Racing Game

The goal of this is to have a two player game in which players mash buttons to try to get to the other end.  First player across the board is the winner.

## Technologies Used

- Javascript / jQuery
- Bootstrap
- CSS
- HTML

## Existing Features

- Two players
- Score board
- Reset button

## Planned Features

- Wanted to add some rocks and stuff to avoid
- Need to fix up some issues between gameplay. Players are still able to move when the game is over.
